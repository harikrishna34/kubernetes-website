The following are the key areas related to pod lifecycle management:

- [Learn more about the behaviors related to Lifecycle Hooks](/docs/reference/lifecycle-events/hooks/) for managing tasks during container startup or shutdown.
  - Lifecycle hooks like `PreStop` and `PostStart` allow you to execute commands or run HTTP requests at critical points in a containerâ€™s lifecycle. These hooks ensure proper initialization or graceful termination.
