* You've created a Kubernetes cluster that uses `kubectl` 1.14 or higher. 
* If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node/), or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:

    * [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/kubernetes)
    * [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)

* You've configured the kubectl command-line tool to communicate with your cluster.
* We recommend running this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts.
