* You have a Kubernetes cluster with a least two nodes that aren't
  control plane hosts.

  <!-- We previously digressed a good bit here talking about how to create a cluster.
  I'd keep it brief and provide a link for users that need it. -->
  To create a cluster, see [Using Minikube to Create a Cluster](/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/create-cluster/cluster-intro/).
